# About Project

TutorMe is a mobile application intended to be the bridge between students and the expert tutors who can help with their learning goal through online video sessions. The app allows users to create an account, load their in-app wallet using Khali, request a session, receive notifications and join the scheduled video call once the tutor accepts the session request. The platform aims to provide a personalized learning and doubt solving experience as the students can get lectures, suggestions, and problem solving through a two-way communication channel unlike the recorded courses. This is especially helpful if the learners get stuck on some problems and require guidance from the experts. Developed using Node.js & MongoDB for backend and Flutter with clean architecture for frontend, the application prioritizes intuitive UI along with security and scalability.
